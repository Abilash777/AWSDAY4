 https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/?nc=sn&loc=3

 Amazon S3 Storage Classes:

 ============================
 Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases.
 These include S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data;
 S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access patterns; S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
 (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 
 for long-lived, but less frequently accessed data; and Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) 
 and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive
 and digital preservation. If you have data residency requirements that canâ€™t be
 met by an existing AWS Region, you can use the S3 Outposts storage class to 
 store your S3 data on-premises. Amazon S3 also offers capabilities to manage
 your data throughout its lifecycle. Once an S3 Lifecycle policy is set, 
 your data will automatically transfer to a different storage class without
 any changes to your application. 


General purpose
Amazon S3 Standard (S3 Standard)
================================

S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently 
accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, 
S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, 
including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution,
 mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics. 
 S3 Storage Classes can be configured at the object level 
 and a single bucket can contain objects stored across S3 Standard, 
 S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA. 
 You can also use S3 Lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between storage 
 classes without any application changes. 
 
 
 Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering):
 ========================================================
 
 Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering) is the only cloud storage
 class that delivers automatic cost savings by moving objects between four access
 tiers when access patterns change. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed
 to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, 
 without operational overhead. 
 
 
 Key Features:
 =============

Automatically optimizes storage costs for data with changing access patterns
Stores objects in four access tiers, optimized for frequent, infrequent, archive, and deep archive access
Frequent and Infrequent Access tiers have same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
Activate optional automatic archive capabilities for objects that become rarely accessed
Archive access and deep Archive access tiers have same performance as Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive
Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
Designed for 99.9% availability over a given year


Infrequent access
Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
====================================================

S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently,
 but requires rapid access when needed. 
 S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, 
 high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard,
 with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. 
 
 Key Features:
 ================

Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction
Designed for 99.9% availability over a given year

Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
=====================================================

S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, 
but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other S3 Storage 
Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs),
 S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA. 
 S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently 
 accessed data but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or 
 S3 Standard-IA. Itâ€™s a good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premises
 data or easily re-creatable data. You can also use it as cost-effective storage 
 for data that is replicated from another AWS Region using S3 Cross-Region Replication.
 
 Key Features:
 ================
Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects in a single Availability Zoneâ€ 
Designed for 99.5% availability over a given year
Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes

Archive
Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier)
===============================

S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. 
You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper 
than on-premises solutions. To keep costs low yet suitable for varying needs, 
S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from a few minutes to hours.
 You can upload objects directly to S3 Glacier, or use S3 Lifecycle policies
 to transfer data between any of the S3 Storage Classes for active data (S3 Standard,
 S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA) and S3 Glacier. 
 
 Key Features:
 ==================
Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction
Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
Low-cost design is ideal for long-term archive
Configurable retrieval times, from minutes to hours

Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive)
==========================================================
S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3â€™s lowest-cost storage class and supports 
long-term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed 
once or twice in a year. It is designed for customers â€” particularly those 
in highly-regulated industries, such as the Financial Services, Healthcare,
 and Public Sectors â€” that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet 
 regulatory compliance requirements. 
 
 Key Features:
 ================

Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zone
Lowest cost storage class designed for long-term retention of data that will be retained for 7-10 years
Ideal alternative to magnetic tape libraries
Retrieval time within 12 hours.

What is Cloud VPC?
Create VPC,Subnet Route table in public and Private and create NAT gateway

NAT Gateway and NAT instance:

NAT Gateway.
Highly available.NAT gateways in each Availability Zone are implemented with redundancy.
Create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone to ensure zone-independent architecture. 
Scale up to 45 Gbps.
Managed by AWS. You do not need to perform any maintenance.
Charged depending on the number of NAT gateways you use, duration of usage, and amount of data that you send through the NAT gateways. 
Automatically selected from the subnet's IP address range when you create the gateway

NAT instance.
Use a script to manage failover between instances.
Depends on the bandwidth of the instance type.
Managed by you, for example, by installing software updates or operating system patches on the instance.
