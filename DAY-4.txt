What is Cloud VPC?
Create VPC,Subnet Route table in public and Private and create NAT gateway

NAT Gateway and NAT instance:

NAT Gateway.
Highly available.NAT gateways in each Availability Zone are implemented with redundancy.
Create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone to ensure zone-independent architecture. 
Scale up to 45 Gbps.
Managed by AWS. You do not need to perform any maintenance.
Charged depending on the number of NAT gateways you use, duration of usage, and amount of data that you send through the NAT gateways. 
Automatically selected from the subnet's IP address range when you create the gateway

NAT instance.
Use a script to manage failover between instances.
Depends on the bandwidth of the instance type.
Managed by you, for example, by installing software updates or operating system patches on the instance. 
Assign a specific private IP address from the subnet's IP address range when you launch the instance. 
Charged depending on the number of NAT instances that you use, duration of usage, and instance type and size.

VPC Peering 
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs
that enables you to route traffic between them using private IP addresses.
