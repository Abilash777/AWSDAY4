What is Cloud VPC?
Create VPC,Subnet Route table in public and Private and create NAT gateway

NAT Gateway and NAT instance:

NAT Gateway.
Highly available.NAT gateways in each Availability Zone are implemented with redundancy.
Create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone to ensure zone-independent architecture. 
Scale up to 45 Gbps.
Managed by AWS. You do not need to perform any maintenance.
Charged depending on the number of NAT gateways you use, duration of usage, and amount of data that you send through the NAT gateways. 
Automatically selected from the subnet's IP address range when you create the gateway

NAT instance.
Use a script to manage failover between instances.
Depends on the bandwidth of the instance type.
Managed by you, for example, by installing software updates or operating system patches on the instance. 
Assign a specific private IP address from the subnet's IP address range when you launch the instance. 
Charged depending on the number of NAT instances that you use, duration of usage, and instance type and size.

VPC Peering 
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs
that enables you to route traffic between them using private IP addresses.

AWS RDS
RDS stands for Relational Database Service platform to use Database services

It allows you to create database in the cloud that are managed by AWS.
Postgress/Mysql/MariaDB/Oracle/Microsoft SQL Server
            
1. Managed Service
2. OS Patching level
3. Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp
   (Point in time Restore)
4. Monitoring Dashboards
5. Read replicas for improved read performance
6. Multi AZ setup for DR {Distaster Recovery}
7. But you can't SSH into your instances.
  
RDS Read Replicas for read scalability --image
=============================================
1. Up to 5 Read Replicas 
2. within AZ , Cross AZ or Cross Region.'
3. Replication is ASYNC so reads are eventually consistent

RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
================================

1. SYNC replication
2. One DNS name -Automatic app failover to standby
3. Increase availability

RDS Backups:
===========
1. Backups are automatically enabled in RDS.
2. Automated backups:
3. Daily full snapshot of the database
4. capture transaction logs is real time.
5. Ability to restore to any real time
6. 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)
7. DB snapsoht
8. Manually triggered by the user
9. Retention of backup for as long as you want.

Cloud Formation
================

• Building AWS infrastructure as a code
• Design a template
• Create a Template from your Existing
Resources

AWS CloudFormation gives you an easy way to model a collection of related AWS and 
third-party resources, provision them quickly and consistently, and manage them 
throughout their lifecycles, by treating infrastructure as code. A CloudFormation 
template describes your desired resources and their dependencies so you can launch 
and configure them together as a stack. You can use a template to create, update, 
and delete an entire stack as a single unit, as often as you need to, instead of managing
resources individually. You can manage and provision stacks across multiple AWS accounts 
and AWS Regions.

Dynamo DB
----------
Managed NoSQL Database
It is a non relational database---------- IT having no structure /No Sql database
fully managed by Amazon auto updates,patches
10 trillion 10 power 12 request it will handle
fastest data transfer DB in world
maintain/autoscale/backup all are handled by AWS
AWS provide SLA for this service
Single digit milli second latency
Low cost and autoscale
Distributed


users using Dynamo DB Nike,Samsung,	GE aviation


Pricing depends on RCU -Read Capacity Units
not based on server/storage
0.00013$ per RCU

---------------------------------------------

AWS Lambda
Serverless Computing service
Server Managed by AWS We no need to manage the server
We just need to give the code Python,Ruby,Nodejs,PHP
Its a kind of automation service
For ex:-
1.Alexa ---
2.Start and Stop EC2 instance
3.S3 if you upload png automatically it changes to jpeg to particular folder

Cloud Formation LAB: 
aws link and take template 
Json/Yaml(Human readable)
parameter---name and what types of instance we need
Mapping -----instance types and value mapping 
Resources----------What are the things we are creating in json (Must needed)
Outputs-------------Created Json Output

AWS CLI
AWS Command Line Interface
==========================	
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. 
With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the
command line and automate them through scripts.
	
Create one IAM user with administrator previlage

aws --version

aws configure 
AWS Access Key Id :
AWS Secret Key ID : 
Default region name : ap-south-1
Default output format :

aws s3 ls
